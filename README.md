# Soundcore

An [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) shell plugin that adds a bar widget for
controlling Soundcore headphones and earbuds: sound mode (ANC/Transparency/
Normal), noise-canceling sub-mode, equalizer presets, and a live 8-band
custom EQ.

It's a thin UI over [OpenSCQ30](https://github.com/Oppzippy/OpenSCQ30), the
open-source Soundcore control library/CLI for Linux. Whatever settings
OpenSCQ30 exposes for your specific model (sound modes, equalizer, battery)
are what the panel shows — the widget reads the device's capabilities at
runtime rather than assuming a fixed feature set, so it degrades gracefully
on models with partial support (e.g. some earbuds only expose battery level,
no sound mode/EQ control) and picks up new capabilities automatically as
OpenSCQ30 adds them.

## Requirements

- [`openscq30-cli`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openscq30-cli) (or
  `openscq30-cli-bin`) installed and on `PATH`. On Arch/Omarchy:
  ```
  omarchy pkg aur add openscq30-cli-bin
  ```
  Prefer the `-bin` package unless you specifically need a newer version —
  building `openscq30-cli` from source also compiles its GUI counterpart,
  which is memory-heavy and can strain machines with limited RAM.
- Your headphones paired over Bluetooth (`bluetoothctl` or your system
  Bluetooth settings) — normal OS-level pairing, separate from OpenSCQ30.
- Your device registered with OpenSCQ30 itself:
  ```
  openscq30-cli list-models                     # find your model id
  openscq30-cli paired-devices add \
    --mac-address AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF \
    --model SoundcoreXXXX
  ```

## Install

```
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/s-w-3/omarchy-plugin-soundcore.git --enable
omarchy bar move io.github.s-w-3.soundcore --section right
```

## Usage

Click the headphone icon in the bar. The panel shows whichever
OpenSCQ30-paired device is currently connected over Bluetooth:

- **Sound mode** — Normal / Transparency / Noise Canceling (options vary by
  model)
- **Noise Canceling** — sub-mode buttons, shown only while ANC is active
- **Equalizer preset** — dropdown of the device's built-in presets
- **Custom EQ** — live sliders per band; dragging one applies immediately
  and clears the active preset

If no supported device is connected, or your specific model doesn't expose
sound mode/EQ settings in OpenSCQ30, the panel says so plainly instead of
showing empty controls.
